# graduate-courses-notes
Contains information, notes, and personal opinion on a couple of Graduate Level courses I took while studying on my own to improve my Machine Learning. and Software Engineering Skills.
I arranged the courses by the offering university.
## Stanford University
I took a couple of courses from Stanford, especially right at the beginning of my training. The include:
1. [Statistical Learning](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesScience/StatLearning/Winter2014/courseware/d9820868fd3642f19ee45e273e3dfafa/).
This course is a fantastic, and mainly revolves around the book Elements of Statistical Learning. It's a great foundation in Machine Learning, and covers the major ML models, like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting (one of my favourite!), and many others. The Course Authors are among the inventors of a couple of these algorithm.
- Programming Language Used: `R`
- Course Difficulty: Medium to Hard
- Mathematics Content: 

2.
